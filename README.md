"Aaron and the Floating Shaman Head's Super Cool Adventures in Various Realms Both Mundane and Spectacular With Guest Appearances from Some People You May or May Not Know Though the Authors Think They're Totally Sweet (for Some to the Degree of 'Totes McGrotes') and Could Therefore Give Much Less of a Damn for Your Personal Opinion on the Matter"

"How I Played This Game That Was So Awesome That My Face Melted Straight Off Onto the Sidewalk That's Right the Sidewalk and I Had Been Sitting in My Room at My Computer at the Time Playing the Aforementioned Game Do Not Question My Ability to Communicate My Awe Sans Lips"

   More succinctly referred to by the moniker "Aaron and the Floating Shaman Head... Sans Lips" or the initialism "AATFSHSL", this is an entirely silly point-and-click adventure game inspired by 90s PC games such as the Space Quest series.
   AATFSHSL uses the AEngine2 adventure game framework, which was, in fact, created for AATFSHSL. For further information on AEngine2, feel free to examine the source repository at https://github.com/JMarlin/AEngine2
