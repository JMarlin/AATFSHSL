[SHIT FALLS ON AARON AND AARON FALLS AND THE SHIT FALLS ON HIM AS HE FALLS DOWN]
Aaron: AUGH!
[Fade to black]
[Scene fades back in]
Narrator:
	You find yourself lying on the floor, your head pounding, and silently curse yourself for always hiding your messes in the closet.
Aaron[waking up in a daze]:
	I do?
Narrator[As aaron gets up and dusts himself off]:
	getting your bearings, you stand up and dust yourself off.
Aaron:
	I... I guess I do...
Narrator:
	Looking around, you realize that your room is now in a worse state than it was when you began.
Aaron:
	It sure is
Narrator:
	And repress the deep-seated urge to burn it all to the ground and start over again, perhaps in a country without extradition treaties.
Aaron:
	Wait, what
	[Shakes head]
Narrator:
	You shake your head
Aaron:
	No, wait, who are you?
Narrator:
	You wonder aloud
Aaron: 
	No, seriously, stop!! Who are you? What on earth is going on?
Narrator: 
	Panic begins to set in as you contemplate the potential realities of your situation
Aaron:
	HEY! I SWEAR TO GOD, SHUT IT. Now WHAT is going on? Am I going crazy?
Narrator:
	...I don't understand. Are you talking to me?
Aaron:
	OBVIOUSLY
Narrator:
	Well... I'm the narrator of your life's story! 
Aaron:
	My whatnow?
Narrator:
	I'm here to describe all of your inner machinations in such a way as to add deep human interest to the boring events of your everyday
	activities. I mean, you have heard of a narrator before, correct?
Aaron:
	Yeah, I've heard of a narrator, but...
	[sighs, begins kicking things back into the closet]
	I don't have time for more voices in my head. I need to get the rest of this laundry in the hamper and go meet my parents before they leave without me.
