Random "This shit don't work" VO:
----------------------------------

-You consider doing it, and immediately feel a deep sense of shame.

-Not even close!

-On an unrelated note, I've often thought that eugenics might not be such a bad concept.

-Having tried that once myself, I wouldn't reccommend it.

-What a novel concept! But no.

-Maybe it's about time for a break, huh?

-*Deep sigh*

-It seems that there's a bug in the game which renders that a ridiculous idea.

-You think deeply about the uncountable mistakes you've made in your past
 and resolve not to make another one here and now.

-You consider yourself a creative type, don't you?

-Your ideas are just... terrible.

-Nailed it.

-Oh. Oh yeah. No. Yeah. Definitely.



NARRATOR VOs:
-------------

You gaze at your bedroom door and lovingly reminisce upon your shared history:
All of those times that it prevented people from entering your room.

It appears to be some sort of wooden contrivance used, perhaps, to hold rouge clothing at bay.

This is your turntable. It is used to turn the tables on your enemies.
It is also capable, as an added feature, of playing records.

Judging by the state of the turntable, you have figured out how to play a point and click adventure game. Good job.

It's the newest Churromonger album that you saved up for a whole month to buy.
You enjoy the lack of subtlety in its content almost as much as you enjoy the way in which your parents hate it.

It's the poster you bought when you went to see your favorite nusperimental speed-death black-core act, Churromonger, on their most recent tour. Looking at it, you fondly recall the gruesomeness of the onstage fan sacrifices.

What do you want? It's a door.

That's my closet. It does the usual things.

It's some sort of incredibly large CD player.

It appears that some sort of incredibly large CD is playing.

It's some sort of incredibly large CD.

Some day, I'll be as great as Churromonger.
Some day when I've tracked them down and eaten their hearts to gain their powers.

I've GOT to clean up these shirts or my dad is going to murder me with his discipline hatchet.
